Welcome to my Streaming Clone, a modern, responsive web application inspired by popular streaming platforms.

Live Demo: [kokoro-stream](https://kokoro-stream-git-main-devmahlatsis-projects.vercel.app/)

Built with: TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, Vite

About the Project:

This is a personal project I recreated the interface and functionality of a typical streaming service. It includes:
-A homepage showing featured and trending content for movies, and TV Shows
-Movie Card with posters, titles. 
-Responsive design for desktops and mobile
-Dynamic routing for Movie, TV details where applicable

The goal was to learn and practice building a full UI from scratch while improving my frontend skills.

Tech Stack:
Framework: React
Styling: Tailwind VSS
Built Tool: Vite
Hosting: Vercel

Theater mode requested where logo and menu will be hidden by the viewer - Done

Instead of viewing 20 items of each, it will now be 40 or even 60. - Done but looks ugly and boring

Carousel expected perhaps in the home page or all pages.
